  <div class="jist-image">
    <p id="jist" class="autoshow">
      In a far-future dystopia, humanity suffers under the brutal rule of the Zenith Dominion, led by the<br>
      tyrant Drakos. A group of unlikely heroes rises to challenge the empire and fight for freedom.<br>
      <br>
      Kael, a vengeful warrior, wields the plasma greatsword Eclipsion to dismantle the empire after the<br>
      massacre of his people. Mira, a brilliant and compassionate rebel leader, balances her resolve with<br>
      a deep care for the oppressed. Selena, a tech-savvy strategist, uses her intellect and holographic<br>
      tools to outsmart enemies and uncover secrets of the Dominion. Rylan, a roguish ex-bounty<br>
      hunter with cybernetic arms, adds charm and unpredictability to the group while hiding a<br>
      mysterious past.<br>
      <br>
      Their journey begins when they discover an artifact pointing to the legendary Stellar Relics—<br>
      ancient devices capable of rivaling Drakos' power. To unlock their potential, they must navigate<br>
      treacherous planets, battle fierce foes, and uncover hidden truths in the cosmos.<br>
      <br>
      As they face overwhelming odds, the heroes are challenged by not just external threats, but by<br>
      their own doubts and hidden pasts. The story culminates in a final battle aboard Drakos' flagship,<br>
      the colossal Galactus, where courage, sacrifice, and unity will decide the galaxy's fate.<br>

    Kael is a tall, lean young man in his early 30s, radiating an aura of rugged determination. His dark,<br>
    often tousled hair speaks of the relentless battles he has endured, while his piercing green eyes<br>
    burn with intensity, reflecting both his resolve and the weight of his mission. He dons a sleek,<br>
    form-fitting suit of advanced armor with metallic accents, designed to dynamically adapt and<br>
    enhance his combat abilities. Always by his side is a glowing energy sword, a powerful weapon<br>
    that symbolizes his strength and unwavering purpose. Scars etched across his arms and face<br>
    serve as a testament to his painful past, narrating stories of sacrifice and heroism.<br>
    <br>
    Despite the hardships he has faced, Kael remains compassionate and fiercely loyal to his crew. He<br>
    treats them as family, inspiring trust and unity within their ranks. His bravery is matched by his<br>
    relentless drive for justice, fueled by a vision of a better and more equitable galaxy. Kael's<br>
    unwavering moral compass guides him, even when confronted with the most daunting challenges.<br>
    His leadership, though tested by countless conflicts, remains resolute, making him the glue that<br>
    holds the crew together.<br>
    <br>
    As the leader of his team, Kael is the driving force behind their mission to dismantle the<br>
    oppressive empire. He shoulders the immense burden of their shared goal, balancing strategic<br>
    decisions with the well-being of his crew. His ultimate test lies in the final confrontation with his<br>
    brother, Karan, a battle that is as personal as it is pivotal. This decisive encounter will not only<br>
    shape Kael’s fate but also determine the destiny of the galaxy, solidifying his role as a hero of<br>
    unwavering resolve and courage.<br>

    Rylan is a rugged, battle-hardened fighter with short-cropped dark brown hair<br>
    and a scar that runs across his cheek.<br>
    His cybernetic implants on his arms enhance his already impressive strength, and he wears <br>
    lightweight tactical armor designed for mobility and swift movement. A wild card within the rebellion,<br>
    Rylan is known for his sarcasm, bravery, and fierce loyalty to his comrades.<br>
    <br>
    He’s often reckless, rushing headlong into danger,<br>
    but beneath his tough exterior is a heart that beats for those he cares about. <br>
    He’ll risk everything for his friends, even when it means defying orders or taking impossible chances.<br>
    <br>
    Rylan is a master of guerrilla warfare, skilled in hit-and-run tactics, and armed with a plasma rifle<br>
    that he handles with lethal precision. His cybernetic enhancements have made him faster and<br>
    stronger than an average human, allowing him to outmaneuver enemies and strike when least<br>
    expected. Once a rogue mercenary, Rylan’s past is filled with battles fought for money, not cause.<br>
    <br>
    However, after losing his home to Drakos’s forces, he found a new purpose in the rebellion,<br>
    fighting not for redemption but to avenge everything he’s lost. Now, every mission is more than<br>
    just a fight—it’s a step toward reclaiming the galaxy from the tyranny of Drakos.<br>

    Drakos is a towering, ruthless overlord with crimson eyes and pale gray skin.<br>
    He is encased in a cybernetic exoskeleton adorned with glowing red lines.<br>
    His armor radiates destruction, and his energy mace can obliterate entire fleets.<br>
    Cold and power-hungry, he views everyone as pawns in his quest for galactic domination<br>
    "He thrives on fear and destruction"<br>
    taking pleasure in crushing any resistance.<br>
    <br>
    With superhuman strength and speed from his exoskeleton,<br>
    Drakos is nearly invincible in combat.<br>
    He commands a vast army of drones and soldiers, each one loyal to his brutal command. Having<br>
    risen to power by annihilating civilizations and assimilating their technology,<br>
    he now seeks a mythical artifact said to grant godlike powers.<br>
    <br>
    This artifact, hidden deep within the galaxy, could grant him dominion<br>
    over time, space, and even life itself.<br>
    Drakos believes that with this power, he can reshape the very fabric of reality,<br>
    bringing all life under his control.<br>
    As he grows closer to claiming it, no force in the universe seems capable of standing<br>
    in his way, and his hunger for ultimate power grows ever more insatiable.<br><br>

    Inspiring and compassionate, Mira puts her people first, always leading with unwavering<br>

    chances, burdened by the lives depending on her decisions. She is a master tactician, using a<br>
    holographic command gauntlet to project tactical maps and devise battle strategies, which gives<br>
    her a significant edge in combat. Mira is also a skilled marksman, capable of holding her own in<br>
    battle.<br>
    <br>
    Raised on a planet devastated by Drakos's conquests, Mira dedicated her life to fighting back and<br>
    became the heart and soul of the rebellion. Driven by loss and a desire for justice, she continues<br>
    to lead her people in the hope of freeing the galaxy from tyranny, even at the risk of her own life.<br>
